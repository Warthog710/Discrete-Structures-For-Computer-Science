# Discrete-Structures-For-Computer-Science
This course is an introduction to the essential discrete structures used in Computer Science, with emphasis on their applications. Topics to be covered include: binary number representation and arithmetic, sets, relations, functions, formal propositional logic and proofs, digital logic and combinational circuits, finite state machines, regular expressions and formal grammars. Students will implement programs to illustrate principles of discrete structures.
